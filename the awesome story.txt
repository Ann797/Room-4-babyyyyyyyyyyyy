Chip and Chug, the two brothers, were walking in a field. They had just robbed an old lady blind and were in high spirits. “Let’s get some goat!” Chip shouted, and began to laugh maniacally. “No,” Chug answered, “I’d rather get some mushrooms. The money we got from the robbery was enough for us to buy some mushrooms and a new leather coat.”

“No,” Chip said, “I want to get some goats!” He then began to scream and run towards the sky.

“Please,” Chug begged, “I’ll make the money you need. I’ll sell mushrooms, I’ll sell smokes, I’ll do anything! Please!”

Chug sighed and shook his head.

“Chip, you already ruined our leather coat. Please, give me a second to think!”

The wind began to pick up. It blew the leaves around and fluttered them in the breeze.

“I just don’t feel right,” Chug said, closing his eyes. “What if we get caught? What if some drunken fisherman catches us in the middle of an armed robbery?”

“Chug,” Chip said, sadly, “you didn’t hear me say I wanted to rob an old woman blind. The robbery was your idea. I only went along because you wanted to go to the carnival and buy those stupid arcade games. You’re not taking this seriously enough.”

Chug sighed and began to think.

Chip began to look very worried. He paced around anxiously, pulling at his hair and pacing up and down. Chug could see that he was having trouble thinking.

“Is it really so bad to just rob an old woman blind?” Chug asked.

“No,” Chip answered, “but…”

Chip began to sob.

“Look,” Chug said, “I don’t think you’re being serious about this. Maybe you have a problem that you aren’t telling me about. I love you. I want you to be happy. I know you are a wonderful guy. What is it that is really stopping you from stealing old ladies blind? I am your best friend. Can’t you see what kind of person I am? I’ll do anything to make you happy.”

“I can’t, Chug. I have a voice in my head that’s screaming, ‘Cheat, cheat, cheat’ and whenever I think about taking money from this woman, it screams even louder! I have a voice in my head telling me to steal from her, a voice that tells me to rob her blind!”
